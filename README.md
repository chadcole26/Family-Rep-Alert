# Family Rep Alert

When a student has been identified as the Family Rep on the **_Modify Info_** page in the
student record, this plugin will add the Family Rep alert in the admin title student
header. There are no plans to add this to attendance pages (teacher/admin) or the teacher
student header.

The plugin also adds warnings to the **_Functions_** page and **_Transfer Out Of School_** pages for
students alerting the user that the Family Rep identifier needs to cleared and applied to
a different student in the household if there are other students listed on the **_Family_** page
who will remain as active students in the district.
